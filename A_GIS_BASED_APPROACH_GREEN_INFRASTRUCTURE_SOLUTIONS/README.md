Garden Hills is a neighborhood within the nearnorthwest section of the City of Champaign, IL. The neighborhood consists of primarily single family onestory homes, approximately 60% of which are rental properties, and holds a median value of 38K, according to Realtor.com. This is well below Realtor.com’s reported citywide median home value of 151K. The low values within the area are partially attributed to a lack of adequate infrastructure such as, street curbs, sidewalks, street lights and adequate stormwater drainage systems. The most pressing issue is the reoccurring flooding throughout the neighborhood. Therefore, this analysis focuses on the utilization of a GIS based approach toward the feasibility of implementing green infrastructure to address the issue of flooding within the Garden Hills neighborhood. The project team used the definition of green infrastructure as described by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as “Any stormwater management technique or practice employed with the primary goal of preserving, restoring, or mimicking natural hydrology”. Green infrastructure was identified as a particularly attractive solution due to its low installation cost relative to traditional stormwater drainage infrastructure which includes underground pipe and sewer systems.
