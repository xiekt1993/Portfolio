# Analyzing New York City Taxi Data Using Apache Spark
## Introduction
With the rapid development of wireless communication technology and intelligent mobile terminal, collecting the track record of moving objects becomes simple and fast. Due to the fact that the New York taxi trajectory data has not only spatial attributes, but also contains a time attribute, it becomes the research subjects and advanced application for spatial temporal data mining. However, the hot zone of passengers pick-up points will change with time, and at the same time, the city’s available points will affect the passengers’ travel pattern. How to accurately find the concentration of passengers in different periods of time is the necessary condition to the recommend services for taxi drivers. 

Firstly, this report will analysis the New York Taxi trajectory data to get the results of how people commute in the city. As mentioned before, the taxi trajectory data is big data so that the report also utilize the Spark on ROGER to calculate the results. After that, the report will use the methods of spatial autocorrelation to come up with the hot zone recommendation for New York and provide suggestion for city administration and taxi drivers in terms of improvement of the taxi services in these areas.
