# Traffic Detection in Real-time Streaming Footage
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to be able to draw bounding boxes for all cars in dashboard camera footage. Application for such technology, include autonomous vehicles where localization of vehicles is needed to navigate traffic and smart traffic cameras that can monitor the flow of traffic on a busy highway. The real-time monitor application provides a powerful tool for transportation agency to record and analyze traffic data in another way.
