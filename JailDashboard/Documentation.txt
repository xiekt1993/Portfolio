Brief Data Description:
1. Inmate Lookup:
	Data is a snapshot of information on jailed population on the day of extraction.
	Extractable data points include name, race age, bond, address and book date.
	Data is not automatically updated due to the Captcha system of the website. Currently we overcome the Captcha through the following steps: 
		Get in the website http://www1.co.champaign.il.us/SHERIFF/InmateLookUp.php 
		Enter the CAPTCHA phrase shown on the Sheriff's website into your web browser and click the 'Submit' button to the right.
		Right click on the web page that contains detailed inmate information, choose 'Save as', then select 'Webpage, Complete' as the save type. Save the 	html file in the working directory.
	The html file “Champaign County, IL Sheriff_ Inmate Lookup.html” in this folder is the retrieved on 12/5/2016. In order to keep the dashboard components that use this data up to date, we need to download the most recent html page and run our script every time.
